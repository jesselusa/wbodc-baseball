# PRD: Historical Game Results Page

## Introduction/Overview

The Historical Game Results Page allows users to view completed games from past tournaments in a clear, mobile-friendly format. This feature provides a way for tournament participants and viewers to look back at game outcomes, preserving tournament history and enabling users to review how games played out inning-by-inning. The page focuses purely on historical data display, separate from live game functionality.

## Goals

1. **Preserve Tournament History**: Enable users to view completed games from any tournament
2. **Clear Score Display**: Present game results in a familiar baseball scoreboard format
3. **Mobile-First Experience**: Provide optimal viewing on mobile devices during and after tournaments
4. **Simple Navigation**: Allow easy browsing of historical games by tournament
5. **Tournament Context**: Display relevant context about where each game fit in the tournament structure

## User Stories

1. **As a tournament participant**, I want to view the results of games I played so that I can remember how each game went and share outcomes with others.

2. **As a tournament viewer**, I want to see how previous games ended so that I can follow the tournament progression and understand current standings.

3. **As someone browsing later**, I want to look back at historical tournament results so that I can relive memories and see how different tournaments compared.

4. **As a mobile user**, I want to easily view game results on my phone so that I can quickly check outcomes without struggling with the interface.

5. **As any user**, I want to understand what round/phase each game was from so that I can put the results in proper tournament context.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Tournament Selection**: The system must provide a way to filter/select games by specific tournament.

2. **Game Results List**: The system must display a list of completed games for the selected tournament.

3. **Inning-by-Inning Scoreboard**: The system must show runs scored by each team in each inning, presented in traditional baseball scoreboard format.

4. **Team Identification**: The system must prominently display team names for each game result.

5. **Final Score Display**: The system must clearly show the final score and winning team for each game.

6. **Tournament Context**: The system must indicate what phase/round each game was from (e.g., "Pool Play Game 2", "Semifinals").

7. **Mobile Optimization**: The system must provide optimal viewing experience on mobile devices.

8. **Design Consistency**: The system must follow the established design system (neutral color palette, gradients, typography, card layouts).

9. **Completed Games Only**: The system must only display games that have been marked as completed/finished.

10. **Chronological Organization**: The system must allow users to browse games in chronological order or by tournament structure.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Full play-by-play details of individual shots and flip cup rounds
- Player statistics from individual games
- Game replay functionality or step-through capabilities
- Links to related games or player profiles
- Search functionality by team names or date ranges
- Game duration or timestamp display
- Live game monitoring or real-time updates
- Integration with tournament bracket visualization (separate feature)
- Error handling for edge cases (to be addressed later)
- Social features like comments or sharing
- Editing or modifying historical game data

## Design Considerations

- **Visual Design**: Follow established design system with neutral color palette, gradient backgrounds, and consistent typography
- **Layout**: Use card-based layouts consistent with other app components
- **Scoreboard Format**: Present inning-by-inning scores in familiar baseball scoreboard grid format
- **Typography**: Use system fonts with consistent hierarchy for team names, scores, and context information
- **Mobile-First**: Prioritize mobile layout and interaction patterns
- **Navigation**: Integrate with existing navigation structure when ready

## Technical Considerations

- **Data Source**: Leverage existing event sourcing architecture and game_states table
- **Database Tables**: Primary data from `games`, `teams`, and related tournament tables
- **Performance**: Consider pagination or lazy loading for tournaments with many games
- **State Management**: Utilize existing patterns for data fetching and state management
- **Real-time Integration**: Ensure clear separation from live game functionality

## Success Metrics

*To be defined in future iterations*

## Open Questions

1. **Pagination**: Should we implement pagination for tournaments with many games, or load all results at once?
2. **Default View**: When users first visit the results page, should it show the most recent tournament or require tournament selection?
3. **Game Ordering**: Within a tournament, should games be ordered by date, tournament phase, or allow user sorting options?
4. **Integration Timing**: When should this integrate with the future tournament bracket view and home page?
5. **Error Handling Strategy**: What specific error cases should be prioritized when we address error handling?
