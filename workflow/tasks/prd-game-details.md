# Product Requirements Document: Game Details Page

## Introduction/Overview

The Game Details Page is a comprehensive view for individual baseball games that solves the critical user experience gap where users clicking on games from the homepage currently land on a 404 page. This feature will provide live scoring, game context, and detailed information about ongoing or completed games, serving as the primary destination for game-specific information in the WBDoc Baseball Tournament Hub.

**Goal**: Create a mobile-optimized, comprehensive game details page that allows users to view live game status, historical scoring, and contextual information for any game in the system.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate 404 errors** for users clicking on games from the homepage
2. **Provide comprehensive game information** including live status, scores, and context
3. **Ensure mobile-first performance** with <2 second load times
4. **Create intuitive navigation** back to homepage and related tournament pages
5. **Support all game states** (scheduled, live, completed) with appropriate information display
6. **Maintain design consistency** with existing Mauve color scheme and component patterns

## User Stories

1. **As a tournament participant**, I want to see live game status so I can track my team's performance and know when it's my turn to play.

2. **As a spectator**, I want to see detailed scoring and inning information so I can follow the game remotely and understand what's happening.

3. **As a tournament organizer**, I want to see comprehensive game data so I can track tournament progress and answer participant questions.

4. **As a mobile user**, I want the game details to be easily readable on my phone during the event so I can stay updated while moving around.

5. **As any user**, I want to easily navigate back to the homepage or tournament view so I can see other games and tournament information.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real-time updates** - WebSocket connections and live data streaming will be implemented in a future phase
2. **Player statistics** - Individual batting averages and detailed player stats are not included in MVP
3. **Play-by-play details** - Chronological event listing and at-bat outcomes are future features
4. **Push notifications** - Score change notifications are out of scope for initial release
5. **Game editing** - No functionality to modify game data or scores
6. **Social features** - No commenting, sharing, or social media integration
7. **Advanced analytics** - No statistical analysis or performance metrics
8. **Offline functionality** - No offline behavior or caching for offline use

## Design Considerations

- **Color Scheme**: Must use consistent Mauve palette (#fdfcfe, #f9f8fc, #e4e2e8, #8b8a94, #696775, #1c1b20)
- **Typography**: Follow existing component typography patterns from homepage
- **Layout**: Mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints at 768px and 1024px
- **Component Consistency**: Reuse existing design patterns from GameRow, TournamentCard, and NavBar components
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Score should be most prominent, followed by team names, then contextual information
- **Loading States**: Use skeleton screens consistent with existing component patterns

## Technical Considerations

- **Route Structure**: Implement as Next.js dynamic route `/game/[id]` using standardized game ID format (game1, game2, etc.)
- **Data Integration**: Use existing `fetchGameById` API function and `GameDisplayData` types
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement 1-hour cache for game data to balance performance with data freshness
- **Historical Data**: Support all games in the system regardless of age
- **Performance**: Implement proper caching and optimization for mobile devices
- **SEO**: Include proper meta tags with game information for social sharing
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Dependencies**: Builds on existing API layer and type definitions
- **Tournament Integration**: Stub tournament page links for now (to be implemented in future phase)
