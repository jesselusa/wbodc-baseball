### Notes

- Event replay operations should be thoroughly tested with various event sequences
- Undo/edit operations require careful validation to prevent game state corruption
- Takeover operations must be atomic to prevent race conditions
- Client-side queuing should persist across browser sessions using localStorage
- All advanced operations should maintain complete audit trails
