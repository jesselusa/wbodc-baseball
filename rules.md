# WBDoc Baseball Tournament Rules

## Game Overview
WBDoc Baseball is a hybrid drinking game that combines elements of beer pong, flip cup, and traditional baseball. Teams alternate between batting and fielding positions to score runs over multiple innings.

## Setup

### Team Formation
- Divide all players into **two teams**: batting team and fielding team
- Teams switch between batting and fielding each inning

### Cup Setup
- **4 cups** are placed in a row at the end of the table
- Each cup represents a different type of hit:
  - **1st cup** = Single
  - **2nd cup** = Double  
  - **3rd cup** = Triple
  - **4th cup** = Home Run

### Player Positioning
- **Batter**: Lines up across the table from the 4 cups
- **Catcher**: Stands directly behind the cups, across from the batter and t
  - *Note: The catcher is technically on the batting team*

## Gameplay

### The Shot
1. **Batter** tosses a ping-pong ball toward the cups
2. **Catcher** attempts to catch any ricochets in the air
3. **Rest batting team team** waiting for flip cup on makes
4. **Fielding team** waiting for flip cup on makes

### Shot Results
- **Strike**: Ball misses all cups OR ball hits rim and no one catches it
- **Ball**: Ball hits rim and a teammate (batting team) catches it  
- **In Play**: Ball successfully lands in a cup

### When Ball is "In Play"
When the batter successfully hits a cup:

1. **Immediate Flip Cup Round**
   - Batting team vs. Fielding team play flip cup
   - **If batting team wins**: Batter gets the base corresponding to the cup hit
   - **If fielding team wins**: Batter is out

### Base Running
- **New runners**: Start at first base (unless home run)
- **Existing base runners**: Move the same number of bases as the hit
  - Single = 1 base, Double = 2 bases, Triple = 3 bases, Home Run = 4 bases
  - **Example**: Runner on 1st base + Double hit = Runner moves to 3rd base
  - **Example**: Runner on 2nd or 3rd + Double hit = Runner scores

## Standard Baseball Rules Apply

### Outs, Balls, and Strikes
- **3 outs** per inning (then teams switch)
- **4 balls** = Walk (batter advances to first base)
- **3 strikes** = Strikeout (batter is out)

### Game Length
Games can be played for:
- **3 innings**
- **5 innings** 
- **7 innings**
- **9 innings**

*Game length decided before start of game.*
