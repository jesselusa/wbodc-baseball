# ⚾🍻 WBDoc Baseball Tournament Hub

*The ultimate mobile-friendly tournament hub for our annual reunion weekend*

## 🎯 What We're Building

WBDoc Baseball is a custom tournament management system built for our Halloweekend reunion, featuring the legendary hybrid drinking game that combines **beer pong + flip cup + baseball**. This isn't just a scoreboard—it's the central hub for the entire weekend's experience.

### 🏆 The Game
Our signature tournament game features:
- **4 cups** representing singles, doubles, triples, and home runs
- **Shot mechanics** with ricochet catching by teammates
- **Flip cup battles** that determine if hits become actual bases or outs
- **Traditional baseball scoring** with configurable game lengths (3, 5, 7, or 9 innings)

### 📱 The Experience
A mobile-first web app that serves as mission control for:
- **Live scoring** with real-time updates during games
- **Tournament brackets** and standings
- **Player stats** and leaderboards
- **Photo sharing** and memories
- **Inside jokes** and weekend highlights
- **Schedule management** for all weekend events

## 🛠 Tech Stack

We've chosen a modern, real-time capable stack optimized for rapid development:

- **Frontend:** Next.js + React with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + real-time subscriptions)
- **UI Components:** Radix UI for accessible, customizable components  
- **Deployment:** Vercel for seamless Next.js hosting
- **Database:** Complex relational schema with event sourcing for game mechanics

## 🗄 Database Architecture

Our database captures the full complexity of WBDoc Baseball:

- **12 tables** covering players, teams, tournaments, and games
- **Real-time game state** tracking current batter, base runners, and count
- **Event sourcing** for every shot, flip cup round, and base running play
- **Statistics aggregation** for batting averages, flip cup win rates, and more
- **Tournament management** supporting multiple years of competition

See [`supabase/database-schema.md`](./supabase/database-schema.md) for complete schema documentation.

## 🎮 Game Rules

The complete WBDoc Baseball rulebook is documented in [`rules.md`](./rules.md), covering:
- Setup and player positioning
- Shot mechanics and scoring
- Flip cup resolution system  
- Base running calculations
- Traditional baseball rules integration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (latest LTS)
- Supabase account and project
- Git for version control

### Database Setup
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the schema migration:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste contents of supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
   -- into your Supabase SQL Editor
   ```
3. Seed with test data:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste contents of supabase/seed/001_test_data.sql
   -- into your Supabase SQL Editor
   ```
4. Seed this year's attendee roster:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste contents of scripts/seed-2026-attendees.sql
   -- into your Supabase SQL Editor (safe to re-run)
   ```

### Frontend Setup (Coming Soon)
